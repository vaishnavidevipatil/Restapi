# RESTful API with Flask and GraphQL
This project demonstrates how to create a RESTful API using Flask and integrate GraphQL for more flexible data querying.


## Technologies Used

Reparse- In Flask, particularly when using the Flask-RESTful extension, RequestParser is a utility that helps to parse and validate incoming request data. It simplifies the process of handling input data from different sources such as query parameters, form data, and JSON payloads.

@GrahQL - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It was developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as an open-source project in 2015. GraphQL provides a more efficient, flexible, and powerful alternative to RESTful APIs.

Our project will use the following libraries:
Flask — this is the web server that we’ll use
Flask-SQLAlchemy — an ORM that makes it easier for us to communicate with our SQL database
Ariadne — a library for GraphQL python integration
Flask-Cors — an extension for Cross Origin Resource Sharing

GraphQL 
HTTP method used is POST always
Query - to fetch data
Mutation - to modify data (insert, update, delete)
Subscription: Realtime data with web sockets.
